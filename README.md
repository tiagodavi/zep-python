</h1>

## What is Zep?
Zep is an open source platform for productionizing LLM apps. Zep summarizes, embeds, and enriches chat histories and documents asynchronously, ensuring these operations don't impact your user's chat experience. Data is persisted to database, allowing you to scale out when growth demands. As drop-in replacements for popular LangChain components, you can get to production in minutes without rewriting code.

## Installation
```bash
pip install git+git@github.com:tiagodavi/zep-python.git
```
